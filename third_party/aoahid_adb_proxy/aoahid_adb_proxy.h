/*
 * Claims the device's ADB interface (0xFF/0x42/0x01) as a Channel and serves it
 * on 127.0.0.1:tcp_port for `adb connect`, from background threads.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *  - The device's Context uses AOAHID_EVENT_INTERNAL_THREAD.
 *  - The device exposes an ADB interface (USB debugging on; current USB mode or
 *    accessory mode, e.g. 18d1:2d01).
 *  - No adb server holds that interface (run `adb kill-server` first).
 *  - Avoid ports 5555-5585 (adb's emulator scan range); 6555 is a good default.
 *
 * Returns AOAHID_ADB_PROXY_OK (0), or one of the AOAHID_ADB_PROXY_ERR_* values
 * above. *out_proxy is NULL on every failure.
 *
 * If reading from the device fails later (unplugged, or any USB read error),
 * the proxy stops serving and closes the port, so `adb connect` is refused.
 * aoahid_adb_proxy_stop must still be called to release the rest.

 * takes up to ~1 s longer if the device has stopped reading, plus up to the

 * Call before closing the device. NULL is ignored. */
